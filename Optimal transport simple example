# Optimal Transport: Super Simple Example with Numbers



## The Simplest Case: 2 Dirt Piles, 2 Holes

### Setup
- **Pile A**: 3 tons of dirt at location (0, 0)
- **Pile B**: 2 tons of dirt at location (4, 0)
- **Hole X**: needs 2 tons at location (1, 0)  
- **Hole Y**: needs 3 tons at location (3, 0)

**Total dirt = 3 + 2 = 5 tons**
**Total needed = 2 + 3 = 5 tons** ✓

### Step 1: Calculate Distances (Costs)

Since all points are on a line (y = 0), distance is just the difference in x-coordinates:

**Distance Matrix:**
- A to X: |1 - 0| = 1 unit
- A to Y: |3 - 0| = 3 units  
- B to X: |1 - 4| = 3 units
- B to Y: |3 - 4| = 1 unit

**Cost Matrix (at $10 per ton per unit):**
- A to X: 1 × $10 = $10 per ton
- A to Y: 3 × $10 = $30 per ton
- B to X: 3 × $10 = $30 per ton  
- B to Y: 1 × $10 = $10 per ton

| From/To | Hole X | Hole Y |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Pile A (3 tons) | $10 | $30 |
| Pile B (2 tons) | $30 | $10 |

### Step 2: Convert to Fractions (Probability Measures)

**Source distribution μ:**
- μ(A) = 3/5 = 0.6 (Pile A has 60% of total dirt)
- μ(B) = 2/5 = 0.4 (Pile B has 40% of total dirt)

**Target distribution ν:**  
- ν(X) = 2/5 = 0.4 (Hole X needs 40% of total dirt)
- ν(Y) = 3/5 = 0.6 (Hole Y needs 60% of total dirt)

### Step 3: Find Transport Plan

We need to decide: **How much dirt goes from each pile to each hole?**

Let π(i,j) = fraction of total dirt moving from pile i to hole j

**Constraints:**
1. π(A,X) + π(A,Y) = 0.6 (all dirt from A must go somewhere)
2. π(B,X) + π(B,Y) = 0.4 (all dirt from B must go somewhere)  
3. π(A,X) + π(B,X) = 0.4 (hole X must get exactly what it needs)
4. π(A,Y) + π(B,Y) = 0.6 (hole Y must get exactly what it needs)
5. All π(i,j) ≥ 0 (can't move negative dirt)

### Step 4: Try Different Solutions (SLOW BREAKDOWN)

I need to figure out how much dirt to send from each pile to each hole.

**Remember what I have:**
- Pile A has 0.6 (which is 3 tons)
- Pile B has 0.4 (which is 2 tons)
- Hole X needs 0.4 (which is 2 tons)  
- Hole Y needs 0.6 (which is 3 tons)

**Remember the costs:**
- A→X costs $10 per ton (CHEAP)
- A→Y costs $30 per ton (EXPENSIVE)
- B→X costs $30 per ton (EXPENSIVE)
- B→Y costs $10 per ton (CHEAP)

**Solution 1: "Try to use cheap routes first"**

**Step 4a:** Look for the cheapest moves
- A→X costs $10 ← This is cheap!
- B→Y costs $10 ← This is cheap!

**Step 4b:** Try to send as much as possible on these cheap routes

**For A→X (cheap route):**
- A has 0.6 available
- X needs 0.4  
- How much can I send? The smaller amount = min(0.6, 0.4) = 0.4
- So: Send 0.4 from A to X

**For B→Y (cheap route):**
- B has 0.4 available  
- Y needs 0.6
- How much can I send? The smaller amount = min(0.4, 0.6) = 0.4
- So: Send 0.4 from B to Y

**Step 4c:** Check what's left over

After using cheap routes:
- A started with 0.6, sent 0.4 to X, has 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2 left
- B started with 0.4, sent 0.4 to Y, has 0.4 - 0.4 = 0.0 left
- X needed 0.4, got 0.4 from A, needs 0.4 - 0.4 = 0.0 more ✓ (satisfied!)
- Y needed 0.6, got 0.4 from B, needs 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2 more

**Step 4d:** Handle leftovers
- A still has 0.2 left to give
- Y still needs 0.2 more
- The only option left is A→Y (even though it's expensive at $30)
- So: Send 0.2 from A to Y

**Step 4e:** Write down my complete solution

| From/To | Hole X | Hole Y | Total sent |
|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| Pile A | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.6 ✓ |
| Pile B | 0.0 | 0.4 | 0.4 ✓ |
| **Total received** | **0.4** ✓ | **0.6** ✓ | **1.0** |

**Step 4f:** Calculate the total cost
- A→X: 0.4 × $10 = $4.00
- A→Y: 0.2 × $30 = $6.00  
- B→Y: 0.4 × $10 = $4.00
- **Total Cost = $4.00 + $6.00 + $4.00 = $14.00**

This is Solution 1. Now let me try a completely different approach...

### Step 5: Try Another Solution

**Solution 2: "Different Strategy"**

What if we try:
- A→Y: 0.6 (send all of A to Y)
- But Y only needs 0.6, so this works perfectly!
- B→X: 0.4 (send all of B to X)  
- But X only needs 0.4, so this works too!

**Transport Plan 2:**
| From/To | Hole X | Hole Y | Total |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Pile A | 0.0 | 0.6 | 0.6 ✓ |
| Pile B | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.4 ✓ |
| **Total** | **0.4** ✓ | **0.6** ✓ | **1.0** |

**Cost Calculation:**
- A→Y: 0.6 × $30 = $18.00
- B→X: 0.4 × $30 = $12.00
- **Total Cost = $18.00 + $12.00 = $30.00**

### Step 6: Compare Solutions

- **Solution 1 (Greedy): $14.00**
- **Solution 2 (Alternative): $30.00**

**Solution 1 is much better!** This is our optimal transport plan.

### Step 7: Convert Back to Real Tons

**Optimal solution in actual tons:**
- From A to X: 0.4 × 5 = 2 tons
- From A to Y: 0.2 × 5 = 1 ton  
- From B to Y: 0.4 × 5 = 2 tons

**Verification:**
- Pile A sends: 2 + 1 = 3 tons ✓
- Pile B sends: 2 tons ✓
- Hole X receives: 2 tons ✓  
- Hole Y receives: 1 + 2 = 3 tons ✓

### Step 8: The Wasserstein Distance

The **Wasserstein distance** between our dirt distribution and hole distribution is:

**W₁(dirt, holes) = $14.00**

This number tells us the minimum cost to transform the dirt distribution into the hole distribution.

## Key Insights with Numbers

1. **Always try the cheapest moves first**, but respect the constraints
2. **The optimal cost ($14.00) is much less than naive approaches ($30.00)**
3. **Wasserstein distance ($14.00) measures how "different" the two distributions are**
4. **If dirt and holes were in the same places, Wasserstein distance would be $0**

## Real World Meaning

- In machine learning: This $14.00 tells us how much "work" is needed to transform one dataset into another
- In economics: This represents the most efficient allocation of resources  
- In physics: This relates to the minimum energy needed for a transformation

The math gives us the **provably best solution** - no other transport plan can cost less than $14.00!
